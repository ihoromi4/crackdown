# Crackdown

Crackdown is framework for deep reinforcement learning inspired by computer games playing.
It is flexible PyTorch-based general purpose framework. It is made with *plug-and-play* principle in mind and is based on the *Open AI Gym API*.

## Algorithms

Supported training algorithms:

* Vanilla Policy Gradient [VPG]
* Advantage Actor Critic [A2C]
* Random Network Distillation [RND]
* Soft Actor Critic [SAC]

## Installation

You can install the latest version from source with:

```
git clone https://github.com/ihoromi4/crackdown.git
cd crackdown
pip install -e .
```
